### Content Strategy

#### **Hero Copy Decision**
**Recommended:** Option A (Reflective) - "The Story We're Telling Ourselves"
- Aligns with existing training title
- More emotional, philosophical, memorable
- Differentiates from typical compliance training

**Alternative:** Option B (Institutional) - "CMDHD Professional Boundaries Training"
- More direct and formal
- Available if stakeholders prefer traditional approach

#### **Scenario Approach**
**Landing Page:** "Would you..." teaser questions only (3 scenarios)
- Reduces cognitive load
- Creates curiosity gap
- Drives enrollment

**Training Module:** Full scenarios with model phrases and escalation steps (4 scenarios)
- Comprehensive learning experience
- Interactive problem-solving
- Practical application

#### **County Presentation**
**Keep:** Current card grid with stats (works well)
**Add:** Introductory text about mid-Michigan realities
**Optional:** Simple map visualization for visual interest

#### **Policy Integration**
**Current:** Scattered mentions, links to resources page
**Proposed:** Dedicated section (Section 8) with clear access to:
- CMDHD Policy PDF (downloadable)
- Related ethics codes (NASW, ANA)
- Employee handbook
- Support contacts

---

### Working Document Usage

#### **landing-page.md serves as:**
1. **Design Reference** - Canonical 9-section blueprint
2. **Copy Repository** - Store copy variations, finalized wording
3. **Decision Log** - Document design choices and rationale
4. **Stakeholder Communication** - Share with CMDHD leadership
5. **Implementation Checklist** - Track completion status
6. **Iteration Notes** - Record feedback and changes

#### **Recommended Additions to landing-page.md:**
- [ ] Implementation status table (Section â†’ Status â†’ Notes)
- [ ] Copy finalization tracking (which option chosen)
- [ ] Component mapping (Section â†’ React component)
- [ ] Asset inventory (images, icons, PDFs needed)
- [ ] Feedback log (date, source, feedback, action)

#### **Integration with TODO-AI.md:**
- **TODO-AI.md:** Project management, task tracking, technical notes
- **landing-page.md:** Design specification, copy repository, UX decisions

---

### Risk Management

#### **Identified Risks & Mitigation:**

**Risk: Scope Creep (9 sections is substantial)**
- Mitigation: Phased approach, MVP first (1-4), then enhance (5-9)

**Risk: Content Approval Delays**
- Mitigation: Use placeholder content, create approval workflow early

**Risk: Over-Design (too complex)**
- Mitigation: Start simple, add enhancements incrementally, user test

**Risk: Breaking Existing Functionality**
- Mitigation: Thorough testing, consider feature flag for rollout

**Risk: Accessibility Regression**
- Mitigation: Test with screen readers throughout, not just at end

**Risk: Mobile Experience Degradation**
- Mitigation: Mobile-first approach, test on real devices

**Risk: Performance Impact**
- Mitigation: Lazy loading, image optimization, monitor Core Web Vitals

- Reference to 60-minute run-of-show

**Card 3 - Contextual Information**
- Dynamic content based on active section:
  - Policy: Key dates, version info
  - Scenarios: Relevant county statistics

  - Q&A: Discussion prompts count
- Alternative: Quick Actions (notes toggle, fullscreen, print mode)

#### MAIN CONTENT AREA (Primary presentation surface)

- [x] Link /presenter button to /dashboard âœ…
- [x] Replace placeholder content with basic training sections âœ…
- [x] Create separate dashboard layout (no SiteHeader/SiteFooter) âœ…
- [x] Move auth and theme controls to sidebar NavUser âœ…

#### PHASE 2 - Core Functionality
- [x] Implement three top cards (Progress, Timer, Context) âœ… (basic structure)
- [ ] Create SlideViewer component for main content
- [ ] Add URL-based navigation state (e.g., /dashboard?section=scenarios&slide=2)

- [ ] Optimize for projector displays (1920x1080 minimum)
- [ ] Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard focus)
- [ ] Test keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Create presenter guide document
- [ ] Add loading states and smooth transitions

### Components to Create
- `PresentationCard` - Reusable card for top 3 dashboard cards
- `SlideViewer` - Main content renderer with slide transitions
- `ScenarioCard` - Enhanced scenario display (from landing page)
- `CountyCard` - Enhanced county data with charts
- `ProgressTracker` - Visual progress indicator
- `SessionTimer` - Countdown/elapsed time display
- `PresentationNav` - Custom breadcrumb for training flow

### Components to Modify
- `AppSidebar` - Rebrand with CMDHD branding, restructure navigation
- `TeamSwitcher` â†’ `ViewModeSwitcher` - Presentation/Practice/Review modes
- `NavMain` - Training sections instead of platform features
- `NavProjects` - Convert to QuickActions or remove
- `NavUser` - Optional auth integration for tracking

### Data Integration
- Policy content: Parse `docs/cmdhd-professional-boundaries-policy.md`
- Slide content: Parse `docs/slide-deck.md` (markdown sections)
- County data: Move from hardcoded to `/data/counties.json`
- Timing info: Parse `docs/run-of-show.md` for session timing
- Scenarios: Extract from landing page or create `/data/scenarios.json`

### Routing Strategy
- Primary route: `/dashboard` (replaces `/presenter`)
- URL params for state: `/dashboard?section=scenarios&slide=2&mode=present`
- Hash navigation for slide-like behavior (optional fallback)
- Shareable URLs for specific sections

### Visual Design Notes
- **Color coding**: Use primary/accent variants to distinguish 4 scenarios
- **Icons**: Shield (policy), Users (community), MessageSquare (social media), Car (transportation), MapPin (counties), Clock (timing)
- **Typography**: Geist font (modern, professional) - works well for projection
- **Spacing**: Maintain gap-4, p-4 for readability on large displays
- **Responsive**: Optimize for 1920x1080+ (projector standard)

### State Management Needs
- Presentation state (current slide, section, elapsed time)
- Navigation state (active section, expanded items)
- Timer state (session timer, break timer, scenario timers)
- County selection (highlight specific county during discussion)
- Notes visibility (presenter notes toggle)
- View mode (presentation/practice/review)

## Research & Notes Tracking
- Centralized notes: `docs/presentation-notes.md` (web: `/notes`, download: `/api/download?file=presentation-notes.md`)
- Run of show: `docs/run-of-show.md` (download: `/api/download?file=run-of-show.md`)
- Slide deck: `docs/slide-deck.md` (web: `/slides`, download: `/api/download?file=slide-deck.md`)
- Policy reference: `docs/cmdhd-professional-boundaries-policy.md` (web: `/policy`, download: `/api/download?file=cmdhd-professional-boundaries-policy.md`)
- Action: Continue deep-thinking research cycles; keep citations in notes; pair each scenario with 1â€“2 county data points; update scripts and escalation checklist as needed.
