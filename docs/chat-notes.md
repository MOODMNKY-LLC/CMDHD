Our presentation will have polls and live feedback functions. Luckily our presentation is actually a next.js app using typescript and supabase for db and auth. I’d like participants to be able to sign in and participate in the polls and interactive feedback portions of the presentation as we navigate through the slides but I need a comprehensive plan for achieving using what we have. 

Awesome—since you’re already on **Next.js + TypeScript + Supabase (DB + Auth)**, here’s a battle-tested plan to make **live polls + feedback** run smoothly for ~250 attendees while you drive the deck from your dashboard.

I’ll give you a complete blueprint:

* Goals & UX flows (presenter + participant)
* Architecture & data flow
* DB schema (tables, indexes)
* RLS policies (copy-paste SQL)
* Edge Functions / Server Actions you’ll need
* Realtime channels (slide sync, poll state)
* React component map (Presenter, Audience)
* Anti-abuse, performance, and ops checklist

---

# 1) Goals & UX flows

## Presenter flow

1. Sign in (Supabase Auth) → open **Presenter Console** for a `session`.
2. Start session → attendees join with **6-digit code or QR**.
3. Navigate slides; when a poll slide is active → **Open poll**.
4. Watch live results chart; close poll; auto-save to DB.
5. Launch quick **reflection** prompt; display word cloud.
6. End session → **Reports** (attendance, poll distributions, reflections CSV/PDF).

## Participant flow

1. Scan QR → `/join/:sessionCode`.
2. **Join**:

   * Option A (preferred): passwordless **email magic link** (one-tap on mobile).
   * Option B (fast mode): **Guest token** (Edge Function issues short-lived token tied to device + session; see §6).
3. See current slide title; when poll opens → big buttons to vote.
4. Submit reflections; see aggregated results appear live.

---

# 2) Architecture & data flow

```
Presenter (Next.js client) ──┐
                             │    (broadcast: slide/poll state)
Supabase Realtime channel ◀──┼─────────────▶ Attendees (Next.js client)
                             │
Presenter actions (open/close poll, slide change) 
   ↓ (Server Action / Edge Fn)
Postgres (polls, responses, reflections) ⇄ Supabase Realtime (row-level changes)
```

**Key ideas**

* Use **Realtime Channels (broadcast/presence)** to push **current slide + poll state** instantly.
* Persist **responses** in Postgres. Subscribe to **DB changes** for live charts.
* Gate writes with **RLS + server validation**.
* Keep the audience UI dead simple: one action per screen.

---

# 3) Database schema (SQL)

```sql
-- Organizations / courses optional if multi-tenant; keeping minimal for the session

create table sessions (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  title text not null,
  code text unique not null,            -- e.g., 6-char
  presenter uuid not null references auth.users (id),
  starts_at timestamptz,
  ends_at timestamptz,
  status text not null default 'scheduled', -- scheduled | live | ended
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create index on sessions (code);

create table slides (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  session_id uuid not null references sessions(id) on delete cascade,
  order_index int not null,
  kind text not null, -- title | bullets | poll | scenario | reflection | summary
  title text not null,
  content jsonb not null default '{}'::jsonb
);

create unique index on slides (session_id, order_index);

create table polls (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  session_id uuid not null references sessions(id) on delete cascade,
  slide_id uuid not null references slides(id) on delete cascade,
  question text not null,
  type text not null, -- single | multi | scale | yesno
  options text[] not null,  -- ['Accept','Decline','Ask supervisor']
  correct_index int,        -- nullable
  is_open boolean default false,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create index on polls (session_id, slide_id);

create table participants (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id uuid references auth.users (id), -- nullable for guest token approach
  session_id uuid not null references sessions(id) on delete cascade,
  display_name text not null,
  joined_at timestamptz default now(),
  device_fingerprint text, -- optional to limit duplicate votes
  unique (session_id, user_id)
);

create table poll_responses (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  poll_id uuid not null references polls(id) on delete cascade,
  participant_id uuid not null references participants(id) on delete cascade,
  choice_indices int[] not null,               -- supports multi-select
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  unique (poll_id, participant_id)
);

create table reflections (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  session_id uuid not null references sessions(id) on delete cascade,
  participant_id uuid not null references participants(id) on delete cascade,
  prompt text not null,
  text text not null,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

create table attendance (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  session_id uuid not null references sessions(id) on delete cascade,
  participant_id uuid not null references participants(id) on delete cascade,
  joined_at timestamptz default now(),
  left_at timestamptz
);
```

**Indexes to add for scale**

```sql
create index on poll_responses (poll_id);
create index on reflections (session_id);
create index on participants (session_id);
```

---

# 4) RLS policies (secure, copy/paste)

Enable RLS:

```sql
alter table sessions enable row level security;
alter table slides enable row level security;
alter table polls enable row level security;
alter table participants enable row level security;
alter table poll_responses enable row level security;
alter table reflections enable row level security;
alter table attendance enable row level security;
```

Roles:

* **Presenter (staff)**: authenticated Supabase user who owns session.
* **Participant**: authenticated or guest-token user with a `participants` row in session.

Helper function to check participant membership:

```sql
create or replace function is_session_participant(_session uuid)
returns boolean
language sql stable as $$
  select exists (
    select 1 from participants p
    where p.session_id = _session and p.user_id = auth.uid()
  );
$$;
```

**sessions**

```sql
-- Presenters can read/write their sessions
create policy "presenter read session"
on sessions for select
using ( presenter = auth.uid() or status = 'live' );

create policy "presenter write own session"
on sessions for update using ( presenter = auth.uid() )
with check ( presenter = auth.uid() );
```

**slides & polls** (presenter read/write; participants read during live)

```sql
create policy "presenter rw slides"
on slides for all
using (exists (select 1 from sessions s where s.id = slides.session_id and s.presenter = auth.uid()));

create policy "participants read slides (live)"
on slides for select
using (exists (select 1 from sessions s where s.id = slides.session
```


I have another idea that I would like to incorporate, which may require an overhaul of our feedback/interactive components that we're building here. Since we will be presenting to roughly 250 people, I would like the opportunity to make the presentation more accessible by allowing users to submit actual stories or examples of complicated situations or questions about boundaries through this component that we're building here. For instance, there may be a slide with a broad question of "Share your personal perspective on boundaries" or "Share the most questionable situation that you have been with in a client in which you needed clarity". Users are allowed to click something on screen or however the presentation is structured where they can be given a response box and submit a response. That we can then display on screen if we wanted. 

Love this. Let’s design a **Story & Q/A submission system** that slots cleanly into your Next.js + TypeScript + Supabase stack and scales to ~250 people, with **moderation, anonymity, and on-screen featured displays**.

Below is a **complete plan**: UX flows, data model, RLS policies, realtime channels, presenter tooling, anti-abuse/PII safeguards, and implementation steps—so you can ship this without re-architecting the rest.

---

# 1) What we’re adding (in plain terms)

* **Story Prompts**: slides can pose open questions (e.g., “Share a time a boundary felt unclear.”).
* **Participant Submissions**: attendees type a short story (with optional tags like role/county and an anonymity toggle).
* **Moderation Queue**: presenters/moderators see incoming items in real time, can **approve**, **redact**, **feature**, or **archive**.
* **On-Screen Display**: approved stories can be **featured** on the main screen; multiple can be **cycled** or **stacked**.
* **Post-Session Exports**: all approved content (and private queue) can be exported for training improvement.

---

# 2) UX flows

## Participant

1. Join session → sees current slide.
2. Slide contains a **“Share your story”** button → opens modal with:

   * Text area (limit, counter)
   * **Anonymous** toggle (default ON)
   * Optional tags: **County** (dropdown), **Role** (dropdown)
   * **Consent checkbox**: “I confirm I will not include names or identifying info.”
3. Submit → gets “Thanks! Pending review” notice.
4. If their story is featured, participant sees it on their device and on the main screen (read-only).

## Presenter / Moderator

1. Open **Moderator Queue** pane (split right panel or separate Facilitation screen).
2. See **live feed** of submissions with status = `pending`.
3. Actions: **Approve**, **Edit/Redact**, **Reject**, **Feature**, **Unfeature**, **Archive**.
4. “Feature” broadcasts the story to the **Featured Panel** on the main display.
5. Optionally add **labels** (e.g., “Scope/Role”, “Dual Relationship”, “Social Media”).
6. After session: **Export** CSV/PDF; **pin** a few for future scenario bank.

---

# 3) Data model (SQL)

```sql
-- Prompts: attached to slides or stand-alone for sessions
create table story_prompts (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  session_id uuid not null references sessions(id) on delete cascade,
  slide_id uuid references slides(id) on delete cascade,
  question text not null,
  is_active boolean default false,
  created_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- Stories submitted by participants
create type story_status as enum ('pending','approved','featured','rejected','archived');

create table stories (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  session_id uuid not null references sessions(id) on delete cascade,
  prompt_id uuid references story_prompts(id) on delete cascade,
  participant_id uuid references participants(id) on delete set null, -- allow anon
  body text not null,
  anonymous boolean default true,
  county text,       -- optional: Arenac, Clare, etc.
  role text,         -- optional: Nurse, EH, Admin, etc.
  labels text[] default '{}', -- moderator-applied tags
  status story_status not null default 'pending',
  redacted boolean default false,
  featured_at timestamptz,
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz default now()
);

-- Optional: flags (abuse/PII); reactions (applause/upvote if you want later)
create table story_flags (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  story_id uuid not null references stories(id) on delete cascade,
  participant_id uuid references participants(id) on delete set null,
  reason text,
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  unique (story_id, participant_id)
);
```

**Indexes**

```sql
create index on stories (session_id, status, featured_at);
create index on stories (prompt_id, status);
```

---

# 4) RLS policies (secure by default)

Enable RLS:

```sql
alter table story_prompts enable row level security;
alter table stories enable row level security;
alter table story_flags enable row level security;
```

Helper: participant membership check (if you don’t already have it):

```sql
create or replace function is_session_participant(_session uuid)
returns boolean language sql stable as $$
  select exists (
    select 1 from participants p
    where p.session_id = _session and p.user_id = auth.uid()
  );
$$;
```

**story_prompts**

* Participants can **read** active prompts for the live session.
* Presenters can **create/update** for their own sessions.

```sql
create policy "participants read active prompts"
on story_prompts for select
using (
  exists (
    select 1 from sessions s
    where s.id = story_prompts.session_id
      and s.status = 'live'
  )
);

create policy "presenter rw prompts"
on story_prompts for all
using (
  exists (
    select 1 from sessions s
    where s.id = story_prompts.session_id
      and s.presenter = auth.uid()
  )
) with check (
  exists (
    select 1 from sessions s
    where s.id = story_prompts.session_id
      and s.presenter = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

**stories**

* Participants can **insert** for the live session they joined.
* Participants can **select** only their own stories (optional) **and** any story with `status IN ('approved','featured')`.
* Presenters can **read/update** all stories in their session.

```sql
-- Insert by participant into the session they belong to
create policy "participant insert story"
on stories for insert
with check (
  exists (
    select 1 from participants p
    join sessions s on s.id = p.session_id
    where p.user_id = auth.uid()
      and p.session_id = stories.session_id
      and s.status = 'live'
  )
);

-- Read approved/featured stories (public to attendees)
create policy "anyone read approved"
on stories for select
using (
  status in ('approved','featured')
);

-- Optionally allow authors to read their own pending item
create policy "author read own pending"
on stories for select
using (
  exists (
    select 1 from participants p
    where p.id = stories.participant_id and p.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);

-- Presenter RW for their session
create policy "presenter rw stories"
on stories for all
using (
  exists (
    select 1 from sessions s
    where s.id = stories.session_id
      and s.presenter = auth.uid()
  )
) with check (
  exists (
    select 1 from sessions s
    where s.id = stories.session_id
      and s.presenter = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

**story_flags** (optional anti-abuse)

```sql
create policy "participants flag stories"
on story_flags for insert
with check (
  exists (
    select 1 from participants p
    where p.id = story_flags.participant_id
      and p.user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);

create policy "presenter read flags"
on story_flags for select
using (
  exists (
    select 1 from stories st
    join sessions s on s.id = st.session_id
    where st.id = story_flags.story_id
      and s.presenter = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

---

# 5) Realtime channels (what broadcasts)

* **Channel: `session:{id}:slides`**

  * Broadcast `currentSlideId`, `promptActive` boolean.
* **Channel: `session:{id}:stories`**

  * DB changes feed on `stories` table (filtered to session_id); presenter receives `pending`, audience receives `approved/featured`.
* **Presence** (optional): count of connected participants.

---

# 6) Auth patterns for large rooms

* **Primary**: Supabase **email magic link** (fast, friction-light).
* **Fallback**: **Guest session token** (Edge Function issues a signed JWT scoped to `session_id`, short TTL; on submit, server ensures only one active participant row per device fingerprint). Store a `device_fingerprint` (cookie/localStorage) to limit dupes.

---

# 7) UI components to build

### Audience

* `<StoryPromptButton />`

  * Renders only if `prompt.is_active`.
* `<StoryModal />`

  * Textarea with counter (e.g., 600 chars).
  * Anonymous toggle (ON by default).
  * County/Role selects (optional).
  * Consent checkbox (required).
* Submission toast “Thanks—pending review.”

### Presenter / Moderator

* `<ModeratorQueue />`

  * Tabs: **Pending**, **Approved**, **Featured**, **Rejected**, **Archived**.
  * Inline **Redact** (text replace + mark `redacted = true`).
  * Buttons: Approve / Reject / Feature / Unfeature / Archive.
  * Tagging chips: “Scope”, “Dual Role”, “Social Media”, “Touch/Consent”, “Gifts”, “Hours”, “Communication”.
* `<FeaturedStoriesPanel />`

  * On main slide canvas; shows 1–3 cards, with **autocycle** (5–10s).
  * Keyboard shortcuts: `F` feature/unfeature, `↑/↓` cycle, `E` edit/redact, `A` approve, `R` reject.

### Accessibility

* Modal must trap focus; ARIA labels; high contrast; 16px+ font on large screens.
* Presenter can switch **Large Text Mode** for on-screen featured stories.

---

# 8) Basic server logic (pseudo/TS)

**Insert story (Server Action / Route Handler):**

```ts
// POST /api/stories
// body: { sessionId, promptId, body, anonymous, county?, role? }

- validate length (e.g., 20–600 chars), consent checked
- run a quick PII/PHI heuristic (see §10)
- insert into stories with status='pending'
- return { ok: true }
```

**Moderation actions:**

```ts
// POST /api/stories/:id/moderate
// body: { action: 'approve'|'reject'|'feature'|'unfeature'|'archive', labels?, redactions? }

- verify presenter owns session
- optionally apply redactions (replace sensitive fragments)
- update status and timestamps
- broadcasts via Realtime (row change)
```

---

# 9) Slide integration

On any slide where you want stories:

* Include a **Prompt Toggle** (Presenter controls): “Activate Story Prompt.”
* When active, the **Audience** sees the **Story button**; the **Queue** begins to fill.
* Presenter can **feature** select stories during discussion.

---

# 10) Safety, privacy, and anti-abuse

**PII/PHI heuristics (client + server)**

* Warn/block if text contains patterns like phone numbers, emails, exact dates combined with names, “my client [First Last]”, addresses.
* Simple regex set + keyword list (name-like “Mr./Ms.” + capitalized surname), with **presenter override** via redaction.

**Consent & guidance**

* Required checkbox: “No names or identifying info.”
* Microcopy above textarea: “Do not include names, addresses, phone numbers, or dates that could identify anyone.”

**Rate limiting**

* Per participant: max **3 submissions** per prompt; 10-second **cooldown**.
* Length limits (min 20 chars, max 600).
* Auto-flag for review if includes profanity list hit.

**Moderation defaults**

* All stories start `pending`.
* Only `approved`/`featured` are visible to attendees.
* `featured` auto-expires to `approved` after X minutes (optional).

---

# 11) Reporting & export

* **Session Report** includes:

  * # submissions, approval rate
  * Top labels (tag counts)
  * Sample anonymized approved stories
  * CSV of all stories (with status, redacted flag, labels, county/role)
* **Privacy**:

  * Exports include **anonymous** participant markers only (no user_id).
  * Keep `participant_id` internal and RLS-protected.

---

# 12) Performance notes (250 users)

* Use **row-level change feeds** (Supabase Realtime) filtered by `session_id` + `status`.
* Paginate moderator queue (20 per page); stream newest first.
* Debounce updates to featured panel (e.g., 100–200ms).
* Keep payloads small (text only, no attachments).

---

# 13) Step-by-step implementation plan

**Sprint 1 – Core plumbing (1–2 days)**

1. Create tables & RLS (above).
2. Build **Prompt Toggle** on presenter slides (`story_prompts.is_active`).
3. Build **Audience StoryModal** (submit → `stories.pending`).
4. Set up **Realtime** subscription for `stories` per session.

**Sprint 2 – Moderation & display (1–2 days)**
5. Build **ModeratorQueue** (approve/reject/feature, redact, labels).
6. Build **FeaturedStoriesPanel** on presenter screen; wire shortcuts.

**Sprint 3 – UX polish & safeguards (1–2 days)**
7. Add PII/profanity heuristic + consent checkbox.
8. Add rate limiting (server-side guard) + client cooldown.
9. Add county/role selects (optional) and anonymous default.

**Sprint 4 – Reporting (1 day)**
10. Session export (CSV/PDF), story stats, labels heatmap.

---

# 14) Optional upgrades (nice-to-haves)

* **Topic clustering** (after session): group stories by theme using simple embeddings or keyword tags.
* **Upvotes**: let attendees upvote approved stories; sort by engagement.
* **Presenter notes link**: automatically attach policy clause suggestions to tagged stories (e.g., “Dual Relationship → see clause X”).

---

# 15) Copy you can paste into the UI

**Prompt title:** “Share a boundary moment from your practice.”
**Helper text (visible above textarea):**

* “Please do **not** include names, addresses, phone numbers, dates, or any details that could identify a person.”
* “Anonymous submissions are encouraged.”
* “Short is powerful: 3–6 sentences works great.”

**Consent checkbox:**

* “I confirm this story contains **no identifying information**.”

**Moderator labels (chips):**

* Scope/Role • Dual Relationship • Social Media • Touch/Consent • Gifts • Work Hours • Communication • Self-Disclosure

---

If you want, I can generate **ready-to-run SQL** (with your schema naming) and **TypeScript component stubs** for:

* `<StoryPromptButton />`, `<StoryModal />`
* `<ModeratorQueue />`, `<FeaturedStoriesPanel />`
* `useStoriesChannel(sessionId)` hook (Realtime)

Say the word and I’ll drop them in a single paste so you can wire them into your current dashboard.
