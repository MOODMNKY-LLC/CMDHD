- User info compact
- Interactive components as primary content
- Fixed "Progress" button at bottom

### Data Flow

**User Journey:**
1. **First Login** → Demographics form prominently displayed
2. **After Demographics** → Access to all interactive components
3. **Complete Components** → Progress updates in real-time
4. **All Complete + Feedback** → Certificate unlocks
5. **Return Visits** → See completed items, edit if needed

**Progress Calculation:**
- Demographics Complete: Prerequisite
- 2 Reflections: 2 points
- 6 Scenario Polls: 6 points
- 1 Commitment: 1 point
- 1 Feedback: 1 point
- **Total**: 10 trackable items

**Certificate Eligibility:**
- Demographics must be complete
- All 10 items checked
- `completed_at` timestamp set automatically

### Research Data Collection

**Queryable Analytics:**

```sql
-- Scenario performance by experience level
SELECT 
  years_experience,
  avg(case when is_correct then 1.0 else 0.0 end) as accuracy_rate,
  count(*) as total_responses
FROM participant_progress pp
JOIN poll_responses pr ON pp.user_id = pr.user_id
WHERE years_experience IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY years_experience
ORDER BY years_experience;

-- Boundary concerns by role
SELECT 
  primary_role,
  questions_remaining,
  count(*) as frequency
FROM participant_progress pp
JOIN feedback f ON pp.user_id = f.user_id
WHERE primary_role IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY primary_role, questions_remaining;

-- County-specific training needs
SELECT 
  jsonb_array_elements_text(counties_served) as county,
  count(distinct user_id) as participants,
  avg(case when feedback_submitted then 1.0 else 0.0 end) as completion_rate
FROM participant_progress
WHERE counties_served IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY county;
```

## Summary

This enhancement transforms the profile page from a passive dashboard into an **active training hub** where participants:

1. Provide demographic data for research
2. Submit reflections directly on the page
3. Answer scenario polls with immediate feedback
4. Make personal commitments
5. Complete training evaluation
6. Track overall progress
7. Access certificate upon completion

The changes maintain professional healthcare aesthetics while prioritizing engagement and data collection for CMDHD's training effectiveness research.
