# 🧭 PROFESSIONAL BOUNDARIES TRAINING

## I. Opening & Framing *(Approx. 5–7 minutes)*

### A. Slide 1 — *Title: “The Story We’re Telling Ourselves”*

**Objective:** Set tone, emotional resonance, and participant connection.

**Talking Points:**

* “This training isn’t about catching anyone doing something wrong—it’s about clarity and confidence.”
* “The story I’m telling myself is that every professional wants to do the right thing, but sometimes we need shared language for where the lines are.”
* “Boundaries don’t separate us from the people we serve—they keep the relationship safe.”
* Quote: *“By the end, you’ll know the bright lines, the gray zones, and the supervision path every time.”*

**Facilitator Note:**
☑ Pause for reflection: “Take 10 seconds—what story do *you* tell yourself about boundaries?”

### B. Slide 2 — *Why Boundaries Matter*

**Objective:** Link emotional reflection to ethical clarity.

**Talking Points:**

* “Boundaries create predictability. Predictability builds trust. And trust is the foundation of care.”

* “Clarity is kindness. It reduces confusion for both staff and clients.”
* “Boundaries protect both our clients and ourselves from harm or misunderstanding.”

Ask: “Who here works in a smaller town where clients are also neighbors, classmates, or friends? This is where these principles really matter.”

**Talking Points:**

* “We’ll cover bright lines, gray zones, and the supervision path.”
* “You’ll learn a 5-step decision tree to help guide boundary choices.”
